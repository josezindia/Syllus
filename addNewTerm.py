''' 
File Purpose: 
The purpose of this file is to add courses to a new semester given a csv, while
also running debug checks to ensure that no problems occur.  

Instructions:
 - A portion of the data required for this script to run properly directly 
 depends on the format and content of the csv file. Therefore any data that is 
 dependent on csv is located in the Global Variables Section. The intent is to 
 have the server admin edit the global variables to the accomodate the csv and then
 the script should run prperly form there.

 - It is also currently the server admin's responsiblity to filter out all of the courses
 that do not have an instructor assigned to them. You can go ahead and add the course to 
 the database, but without an instructor the software will not hold anyone responsible for
 uploading that syllabi. Therefore, it may be best to seperate those courses into a serperate
 excel file and them to the registrar's office.
