# Our Team
## Student Software Developers Team
Berea college requires every student to participate in a labor program that
requires them to engage in a learning environment that encourages students to be
active learners. Through the Student Software Developers labor program, we provide
our students with the opportunity to learn an array of software development skills
while contributing not only to the community of Berea, but to computer science 
community as well.

## Our Mission
The Software Systems Developers provide technical solutions to Berea College 
through the design and implementation of software to solve Berean problems and
provide technical and professional development opportunities to our students.

## Our Vision
Create a pipeline of student knowldge that support the year to year maintenance
and development of open sourced software.
